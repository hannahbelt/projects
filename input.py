# I kept getting error messages for my syntax 
 # on 'Welcome' but I couldn't understand
 # what was wrong with it. Then I reviewed
 # the entire code and saw that I was missing 
 # a parenthesis after \n'

 # I also wanted to add a "!" and it took me
 # a few tries before I realized it needed 
 # to be in parenthesis

 # After some trial and error I found that a comma 
 # makes a space
